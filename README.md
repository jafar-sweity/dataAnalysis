# Python Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating basic data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and statistical analysis using SciPy.

## Examples

### Example 1: Pie Chart

Visualizes the distribution of people's favorite fruits based on survey data using a pie chart.

### Example 2: Line Plot

Illustrates temperature variations over several days using a line plot, showcasing daily temperature readings.

### Example 3: Bar Chart

Displays the sales performance of different products using a bar chart, depicting sales counts for each product.

### Example 4: Statistical Tests

#### ANOVA Test

Demonstrates a one-way ANOVA test on randomly generated data to compare means across multiple groups.

#### Chi-Square Test

Performs a chi-square test on survey data to evaluate whether the distribution of responses differs significantly from a uniform distribution.

## Instructions

To run these examples, ensure you have Python and the required libraries (Matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, and SciPy) installed. Clone this repository and execute the scripts in your preferred Python environment.

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon these examples as needed.
